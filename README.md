# Startup-Landing-Page-lesson
Quick lesson creating a page using Bootstrap 5 

        /* FIRST COMMIT */
Problems & solutions as of 1st commit: 
  Lesson plan used older version of bootstrap & google fonts; had to update CDN's 
  
 Did not have reference materials provided by the course 
    Wrote my own HTML and CSS, found header 
      Customized layout to fit background img 
      Color picked for higher contrast vs default colors provided in lesson 
 
 Button HR was old Bootstrap ver. 
  Found and updated code for current ver. 
 
 Header img contrasted with button & text 
  Stylesheet: 
    -Added linear gradient (black .7 opacity) over img 
    - h1{mix-blend-mode:difference} to add some dynamic contrast over brighter parts of img 
    -Added transparent border to .btn-primary to prevent movement of text inside div from shifting when hovering over btn
